For categorical variables the first characteristic is designated as a reference against which the others are compared. For numeric variables the results indicate a change per single unit increase. Level - the name or the description of the explanatory variable. N - the number of observations examined. n - the number of observations resulting in the outcome of interest. Rate - the proportion of observations resulting in the outcome of interest (n / N). Class - description of the data type.     2 Odds Ratios estimate the relative odds of an outcome with reference to the Characteristic. For categorical data the first level is the reference against which the odds of other levels are compared. Numerical characteristics indicate the change in OR for each additional increase of one unit in the variable. OR - The Odds Ratio point estimate - values below 1 indicate an inverse relationship whereas values above 1 indicate a positive relationship. Values shown to 4 significant figures. SE - Standard Error of the point estimate. Values shown to 4 significant figures. p - The p-value estimate based on the residual Chi-squared statistic.     3 Confidence Interval - the range of values likely to contain the OR in 95% of cases if this study were to be repeated multiple times. If the CI touches or crosses the value 1 then it is unlikely the Characteristic is significantly associated with the outcome. Lower & Upper - The range of values comprising the CI, shown to 4 significant figures.
