The goal of plotor is to generate Odds Ratio plots from logistic
regression models.

## Installation

You can install the development version of plotor from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("craig-parylo/plotor")
```

You can also install the latest released version from
[CRAN](https://cloud.r-project.org/web/packages/plotor/index.html) with:

``` r
install.packages("plotor")
```

## Example

In this example we will explore the likelihood of surviving the Titanic
disaster based on passenger economic status (class), sex, and age group.

In addition to `plotor` the packages we will use include `dplyr`,
`tidyr` and `forcats` for general data wrangling, the `stats` package to
conduct the logistic regression followed by `broom` to tidy the output
and convert the results to Odds Ratios and confidence intervals, then
`ggplot2` to visualise the plot.

```{r example, message=FALSE}
library(plotor)      # generates Odds Ratio plots
library(datasets)    # source of example data
library(dplyr)       # data wrangling
library(tidyr)       # data wrangling - uncounting aggregated data
library(forcats)     # data wrangling - handling factor variables
library(stats)       # perform logistic regression using glm function
library(broom)       # tidying glm model and producing OR and CI
library(ggplot2)     # data visualisation
```

Start with getting the data from the datasets package.

```{r}
df <- datasets::Titanic |> 
  as_tibble() |> 
  # convert counts to observations
  filter(n > 0) |>
  uncount(weights = n) |>
  # convert categorical variables to factors.
  # we specify an order for levels in Class and Survival, otherwise ordering
  # in descending order of frequency
  mutate(
    Class = Class |>
      fct(levels = c('1st', '2nd', '3rd', 'Crew')),
    Sex = Sex |>
      fct_infreq(),
    Age = Age |>
      fct_infreq(),
    Survived = Survived |>
      fct(levels = c('No', 'Yes'))
  )
```

We now have a tibble of data containing four columns:

-   `Survived` - our outcome variable describing whether the passenger
    survived `Yes` or died `No`,

-   `Class` - the passenger class, either `1st`, `2nd`, `3rd` or `Crew`,

-   `Sex` - the gender of the passenger, either `Male` or `Female`,

-   `Age` - whether the passenger was an `Adult` or `Child`.

We next conduct a logistic regression of survival (as a binary factor:
'yes' and 'no') against the characteristics of passenger class, sex and
age group. For this we use the Generalised Linear Model function (`glm`)
from the `stats` package, specifying:

-   the family as 'binomial', and

-   the formula as survival being a function of `Class`, `Sex` and
    `Age`.

```{r}
# conduct a logistic regression of survival against the other variables
lr <- glm(
  data = df, 
  family = 'binomial', 
  formula = Survived ~ Class + Sex + Age
  )
```

Finally, we can plot the Odds Ratio of survival using the `plot_or`
function.

```{r warning=FALSE, fig.width=9, fig.height=6, fig.format='png', fig.retina=2}
# using plot_or 
plot_or(glm_model_results = lr)
```

This plot makes it clear that:

-   Children were 2.89 times more likely to survive than Adults,

-   Passengers in `2nd`, `3rd` class as well as `Crew` were all less
    likely to survive than those in `1st` class,

-   Women were 11.25 times more likely to survive than men.

## Table outputs

While an odds ratio plot can effectively visualise the direction and
magnitude of relationships, a table of results offers additional
information such as the value of the odds ratio, p-values and confidence
intervals.

Use the `table_or()` function to return a tibble of details about our
Titanic analysis:

```{r}
# using table_or
table_or(glm_model_results = lr)
```

You can also output these details into a formatted table complete with a
mini OR plot, which is ideal for inclusion in reports and publications.
To do this, add `output = "gt"` as part of the `table_or()` function
call.

```{r eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
# using table_or with a formatted output
table_or(glm_model_results = lr, output = "gt")
```

## Assumption checks

New to `plotor` is a new suite of automated checks. These checks verify
the data used in your logistic regression analysis upholds the required
assumptions, providing an added layer of confidence in your results.
